# LAX Flight Delay Analysis

Utilizing the Bureau of Transportation Statistics database our team will perform a month by month analysis of flight Delay incidents for five major airline carriers arriving to and departing from the LAX airport for the 2016 year.

### High level questions:
* How often are flights delayed?
* How long is the average delay?
* What are the most common causes of delay (based on _Cause of Delay_ codes in the dataset)

### Carriers:
* Percentage of delays per carrier
* Are specific carriers more/less prone to delays?

### Time:
* What time of day are delays happening?
* Do any days of the week/month experience higher than normal delays?
* Do any months have higher frequency of delays?

### Origin & Destination Airports:
* Do we see any destinations (from LAX to another airport) that have higher than average delays?
* Do we see higher than average delays arriving from other locations (from another airport to LAX)?
